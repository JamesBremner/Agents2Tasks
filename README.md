Display shows assignments of agents to tasks one timeslot at a time.  

Buttons allow user to navigate between timeslots.  

Radiobuttons allow user to switch between results from the optional algorithms: Maxflow, Hungarian or A2T.

# Algorithm

Maximum flow ( [Edmondsâ€“Karp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonds%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm) ) maximises the number of tasks that are allocated in each timeslot.

The [Hungarian algorithm]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm) is used to minimize the cost in each timeslot using the classic Hungarian cost matrix.

The Agent2Task algorithm uses a strightforward assignment of the cheapest agent to each task in turn.
